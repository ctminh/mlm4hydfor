# mlm4hydfor

Machine learning models for hydrometeorological forecasting

## How to run the code?

The source has two classes of ML models:
* Classical ML models using the built-in API from scikit-learn
* MLP model also using the built-in API from scikit-learn

To run the code:
    `python run.py -m <model_name>`

* LR: linear regression model
* DT: decision tree model
* RF: random forest regression model
* SVM: to be appear
* MLP: multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a name for a modern feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with nonlinear activation functions
